# graph_algorithms_work
This repository contains work from a **Graph Algorithms** class I took in my **first summer session of 2020.** The class explored various algorithms used when
applying graphs to solve various problems, or when analyzing graphs to find a solution to a problem. In the class, we explored various different types of graphs,
including simple graphs, planar graphs, hamiltonian graphs, complete graphs, and many more. As far as algorithms, we discussed many in class, and applied a few in code, while also making use of the
**numpy** library to use arrays and more in manipulating and analyzing our data. Some of the algorithms we discussed were Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, how to
determine if a graph is connected, if it is a tree or not, the minimum spanning tree, as well as how to generate a eularian graph. The algorithms we implemented in code are 
included in this repository, seperated into their respective assignment folders. These folders contain input graphs and output graphs in adjacency matrices, the python programs 
we implemented the algorithms in, as well as pictures of the graphs that were generated. Some of these assignment folders contain a PDF that compiles multiple images of graphs
that were either the inputs for our programs, or were generated using these algorithms.
